Gat Moving
Releasing on Steam soon. Full first person shooter game built fully from scratch. The game was developed as a solo project with some 3D models pulled from external sources. Everything else was fully developed by me.

Get Moving is a fast paced Zombie Survival game, where your goal is to get through levels as fast as you can, while avoiding the attacks from the zombies. As you progress though levels you earn points from zombie kills. These points can be spent on many different things, such as opening doors, unlocking new weapons, or refilling on ammo for your weapons. However, standing still for too long will start draining your health, so make sure that whatever you are doing you are staying on the move.

On top of the main campaign of the game, you can also enter an endless mode, where your goal is to survive for as long as you can against the hoard. With higher powered weapons and faster zombie spawns, its an endurance test to see how long you can last.

This game is developed and released as an item to fit on a portfolio. This means that the game is free to download and play, and it will stay that way. However any feedback and reviews would be appreciated greatly.
